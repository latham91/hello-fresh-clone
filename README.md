## HelloFresh UK Website Clone

This repository contains a clone of the HelloFresh UK website. It was created as part of the week 1 challenge of the Code Nation: Master Software Bootcamp.

### What is HelloFresh?

HelloFresh is a German food delivery service that provides users with fresh, pre-portioned ingredients and recipes for cooking at home.

### What was the challenge?

The week 1 challenge of the Code Nation: Master Software Bootcamp was to pick a website and clone it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, in this project, I decided to focus solely on HTML and CSS (Sass) without integrating JavaScript.

### How did I complete the challenge?

I started by analyzing the HelloFresh UK website's structure using the browser developer tools. I then created the HTML structure for my clone, using CSS (Sass) to style the page and achieved a visually similar appearance as the original.

### What did I learn from this challenge?

This project helped me refine my HTML and CSS (Sass) skills, particularly in understanding the principles of responsive web design. Additionally, it provided valuable practice in analyzing and replicating website structures.

### What's next?

I plan to continue learning about web development, exploring more advanced CSS techniques, and potentially incorporating JavaScript into future projects.
